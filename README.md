# ❓ FAQ

### Q: Where do you get the proxies from?

A: Proxies are obtained from different sources, almost all from open source GitHub repositories or other projects that offer their services for free. Some of the sources are:
1. HTTP:
	- [TheSpeedX's "PROXY-List" repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheSpeedX/PROXY-List/master/http.txt)
2. HTTPS: 
	- [ErcinDedeoglu's "proxies" repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ErcinDedeoglu/proxies/main/proxies/https.txt)
3. SOCKS4:
	- [monosans's "proxy-list" repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monosans/proxy-list/main/proxies/socks4.txt)
4. SOCKS5:
	- [monosans's "proxy-list" repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monosans/proxy-list/main/proxies/socks5.txt)
